							<h2>Fruit</h2>
							<p>In botany, a fruit is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific tissues of the flower, one or more ovaries, and in some cases accessory tissues.</p>
							<p>Fruits are the means by which these plants disseminate seeds. Many of them that bear edible fruits, in particular, have propagated with the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship as a means for seed dispersal and nutrition, respectively; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.</p>

						<li class = "item" id = "grapes">
							<h2>Grapes</h2>
							<p>A grape is a fruiting berry of the deciduous woody vines of the botanical genus Vitis.</p>
							<p>Grapes can be eaten raw or they can be used for making wine, jam, juice, jelly, grape seed extract, raisins, vinegar, and grape seed oil. Grapes are a non-climacteric type of fruit, generally occurring in clusters.</p>

							<h2>Oranges</h2>
							<p>Juicy and sweet and renowned for its concentration of vitamin C, oranges make the perfect snack and add a special tang to many recipes; it is no wonder that they are one of the most popular fruits in the world. Oranges are generally available from winter through summer with seasonal variations depending on the variety.</p>
							<p>Oranges are round citrus fruits with finely-textured skins that are, of course, orange in color just like their pulpy flesh; the skin can vary in thickness from very thin to very thick. Oranges usually range from approximately two to three inches in diameter. </p>

								<h2>Cantaloupe</h2>
								<p>Cantaloupes and other summer melons serve as the quintessential take-along snack for summer picnics and barbeques. Their high water content helps ward off dehydration and combat the heat while their refreshing taste provides a guilt-free, low maintenance dessert for kids and adults alike. The mildly sweet and juicy flavor of cantaloupe makes it a perfect fruit for even the pickiest palates.</p>	
								<p>Cantaloupes are also commonly known as muskmelons, mush melons, rock melons and Persian melons. </p>
